    <h2>Favorite Spots</h2>
    <p>These are some of my favorite spots in NYC. You should definitely go to them!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Food Gallery 32 in Manhattan</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A lot of options to choose from. My go-to food is the taiyaki near the front. <a href = "https://www.foodgallery32nyc.com">This is their website</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>McDonalds near DeKalb Ave</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Convenient, delicious, and cheap(ish). What's not to love?!?!</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Not-So-Great Spots</h2>
    <p>Hate is a strong word, but I <b>hate</b> these places.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atlantic Terminal Mall</li>
        <ul>
            <li>They haven't been letting kids in, but I sneak in anyway. I hate the security guard near the Wetzel's Pretzels</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Starbucks (any location)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Always takes an extremely long time. Also, I'm not sure if spending $8 on a small drink is really worth it.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
